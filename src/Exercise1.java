// If you could receive up to eight different types of radio signals simultaneously (into your
// computer & a program you wrote) and you needed to be able to record which of those eight
// you received at any given time, what would be a highly compact (or compressed - using
// the least amount of memory or storage) way to record them (using what you learned in this
// module)? For example, you could receive signals A + B + C simultaneously, or A + D, or just
// G, etc.
//    1. If you received signals A + D + C simultaneously, how could you efficiently determine
//    that D was one of the signals you received - based on your solution above?
