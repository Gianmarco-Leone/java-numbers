// Make a method, next(), that can be called 10 times and generate a random integer between
// 0 & 10 (non-inclusive). This method keep a running sum of all random numbers it generates
// and return that sum each time. If first time next() is called, it generates 5, and second time
// itâ€™s called it generates 3, it should return 8 from the second call - for example.
